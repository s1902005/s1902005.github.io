# My Qualifications
I'm currently preparing for my DipABRSM exam in piano, but these are my other qualifications to date.
- Piano - Grade 8 ABRSM (distinction)
- Violin - Grade 8 ABRSM (distinction)
- AQA A-level music (A*)
- Music theory - Grade 5 ABRSM (distinction)

I have also recently taken modules in Music Analysis and Composing for Voices & Instruments at the University of Edinburgh, gaining over 70% in both courses.

# A bit more about me...
I currently study maths at the University of Edinburgh, but very much regard music as an equal passion and commitment.
Being a uni student means I can be pretty flexible with times.

In the past, I've played in bands, orchestras, in musicals, I've performed in caves, fields, at ceilidhs and weddings.
I have plenty of experience conducting and leading rehearsals, both for my youth orchestra and my college's production of *Urinetown*.
Currently, I play violin in the Edinburgh University String Orchestra, and have recently enjoyed recording funky arrangements of old church hymns with my mates!

I love to play and listen to a wide variety of styles/genres, and my wish is that my students will feel the same way about music. Some of my favourites include Stevie Wonder, Stephane Grapelli, Rachmaninoff, Radiohead, and Debussy.
