Hey, I'm Will, and I teach piano, violin & music theory in Edinburgh.
Whether you are an aspiring virtuoso or want a more relaxed approach to lessons, I would be delighted to teach you!

I'm based in Newington; I either teach from my flat or am willing to travel to Morningside, Haymarket, New Town or Abbeyhill.
I can also teach music theory or ear training online if you are further afield.
